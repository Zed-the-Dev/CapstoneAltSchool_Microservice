## Infrastructure Setup

- **IaaS Provider**: I chose a cloud provider - AWS where the Kubernetes cluster will be deployed.
- **Provision Kubernetes Cluster**: I used Terraform to automate the provisioning of the Kubernetes cluster, including VM instances, networking, and storage.
- **Network Security**: I implemented network security measures to restrict access to the Kubernetes cluster, such as setting up security groups or network policies.

---

## Deploy Kubernetes Resources

- **Kubernetes Configuration**: I wrote Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts to define the deployment, service, and ingress resources for the Socks Shop microservices application. Ensure modularity and clarity in configurations.
- **HTTPS Configuration**: Letâ€™s Encrypt was integrated for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates and configure the ingress controller to terminate SSL/TLS traffic, ensuring secure access to the application over HTTPS.

---

## Deployment Pipeline

- **CI/CD Setup**: I Configure a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Version Control Integration**: I also integrated the CI/CD pipeline with version control systems (e.g., Git) to trigger automated builds and deployments upon code changes.

---

## Monitoring and Alerts

- **Prometheus Integration**: I deployed Prometheus for monitoring the Kubernetes cluster and application metrics. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Kubernetes components and application services.

---

## Logging

- **Centralized Logging**: I implemented centralized logging with Grafana (Prometheus stack). Configure logging agents to collect logs from Kubernetes pods and services.
- **Log Analysis**: Set up log analysis and visualization dashboards to monitor and analyze application logs for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

---

## Security Measures
- **Network Perimeter Security**: I enhanced security by configuring network policies or security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to the Kubernetes cluster, allowing only necessary ports and protocols.

---

## Optimization and Iteration

- **Performance Optimization**: The infrastrucutre was continously moonitored and optimized for performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency. Bottlenecks and inefficiencies were also identified and addressed.
- **Feedback Loop**: Lastly, I gathered feedback from stakeholders, users, and operations teams to identify areas for improvement. I also iterated on the deployment pipeline and configurations based on lessons learned and evolving requirements.
